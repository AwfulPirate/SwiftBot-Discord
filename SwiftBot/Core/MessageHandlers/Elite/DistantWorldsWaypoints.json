      "desc": "Situated on the far edge of the 'southeastern' part of the Abyss, this system acts as a 61,000 LY distance marker and a navigational waypoint for starships heading out to the galactic rim from the Roncevaux Crossing. It is almost exactly 10,000 LYs to Beagle Point from this beacon star system. This is our penultimate base camp gathering before we set off across the vast Solitude Void... a lonely journey out on the galactic fringe - through ever sparser star systems, beyond which awaits our final goal.",

      "desc": "Finally we arrive at Beagle Point. A star system on the edge of the Milky Way Galaxy offering all who reach it a real sense of remoteness as you look back at the very distant core regions, 35,000 light years away, and realize home is yet another 30,000 light years beyond that! There are not many places in the galaxy that can give an explorer that sense of scale. Outwards looking you see nothing but the vast inky blackness of the intergalactic void. Here at Beagle Point, at least one airless world and several airless moons await our exploration. A 1,200 LY excursion to explore The Moons of Podar can also be planned at this point. Podar is west and south of Beagle Point and sits on the northern edge of the Abyss. It is a ringed Earth-Like World that has 3 airless moons orbiting it - ripe for exploration.",
