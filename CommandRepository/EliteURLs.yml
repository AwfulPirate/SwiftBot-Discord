        **EDDiscovery**
        
        _developed by Finwen_
        
         `
         EDDiscovery is a program that reads your NetLogs and keeps track of what 
         systems you've visited. It can calculate the coordinates of previously 
         undiscovered systems and plot your trail on a 3D map. It can also sync 
         your data with EDSM.
         `
  
         _**Note:**_ The screenshot conversion feature of EDDiscovery is currently
         buggy. You're better off using ScreenShotChanger for now. Use the `!sschanger`
         command to find out more.
      short_help: Keep track of your path, plot it on maps, and sync your progress with EDSM.

        **Captain's Log**
        
        _developed by Genar-Hofoen_
  
         `
         Captain's Log is a program that allows you to keep track of exactly what you've
         scanned on your journey. It keeps track of systems using the NetLogs and runs
         in a non-intrusive overlay window. It also gives you a very rough estimate of
         what your exploration data is worth so far.
         `
      short_help: Keep track of what you've scanned in a system.

        **ScreenShotChanger**
        
        _developed by Voz_
  
         `
         ScreenShotChanger is an application that converts and renames any screenshots you take
         on the fly. It scans your NetLogs to keep track of your current system and features a
         customizable naming scheme using variables. It can convert to and from a lot of different
         formats as well.
         `
  
         _**Note:**_ The recommended conversion setting is to convert from `.bmp` to `.png`. An example
         formatting string is located with an explanation on the sticky post in the `#submit-photos` 
         channel if you're interested.
      short_help: Automatically convert your screenshots to different formats.
