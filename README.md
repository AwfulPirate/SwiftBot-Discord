# SwiftBot-Discord
Discord Bot written in Swift (OS X Command Line)

Currently in a very rough and basic state. It can log in, connect to websocket and handle messages using a reasonably 
easy API. Nothing is stable or complete at this point and the actual BOT features are even more limited than the API 
implementation.

"Deployment" of bot is not yet available - run the SwiftBotBundle (executable SwiftBot) with the program argument being 
a path to a json config file for the time being.

Before building, install cocoapods using "pod install".
