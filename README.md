# SwiftBot-Discord
Discord Bot written in Swift (OS X Command Line)

Currently in a very rough and basic state. It can log in, connect to websocket and handle messages using a reasonably 
easy API. Nothing is stable or complete at this point and the actual BOT features are even more limited than the API 
implementation.
