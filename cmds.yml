    **EDDiscovery**
    
    _developed by Finwen_
    
     `
     EDDiscovery is a program that reads your NetLogs and keeps track of what 
     systems you've visited. It can calculate the coordinates of previously 
     undiscovered systems and plot your trail on a 3D map. It can also sync 
     your data with EDSM.
     `

     _**Note:**_ The screenshot conversion feature of EDDiscovery is currently
     buggy. You're better off using ScreenShotChanger for now. Use the `!sschanger`
     command to find out more.

    **Captain's Log**
    
    _developed by Genar-Hofoen_

     `
     Captain's Log is a program that allows you to keep track of exactly what you've
     scanned on your journey. It keeps track of systems using the NetLogs and runs
     in a non-intrusive overlay window. It also gives you a very rough estimate of
     what your exploration data is worth so far.

    **ScreenShotChanger**
    
    _developed by Voz_

     `
     ScreenShotChanger is an application that converts and renames any screenshots you take
     on the fly. It scans your NetLogs to keep track of your current system and features a
     customizable naming scheme using variables. It can convert to and from a lot of different
     formats as well.
     `

     _**Note:**_ The recommended conversion setting is to convert from `.bmp` to `.png`. An example
     formatting string is located with an explanation on the sticky post in the `#submit-photos` 
     channel if you're interested.
